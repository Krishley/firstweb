<h1>JUMPSHOT</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<font color="black">
[Verse 1]
Let's give it a shot, you and I on the court</p>
Time ticking on the clock, baby, I'm a try to score</p>
Cause you the hottest on the block</p>
Nothin' dimmin' your light</p>
But all the options that you got wouldn't ever treat you right, no </p>
I don't need a telescope to see that you're the one</p>
But I do need your time and if it ain't yours, I'd rather have none </p>
I don't need a fortune teller to tell me my fortune</p>
I have a million signs that my fortune just begun </p>
<br>
You got me jumping like</p>
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom</p>
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom</p>
Boom shakala, boom shakala, ooh</p>
Wanna hold you down</p>
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom</p>
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom</p>
Boom shakala, boom shakala, ooh</p>
Wanna hold you down</p>
<br>
I said, back at it again with the jumpshot</p>
I'm aiming for you and I won't stop</p>
Back at it again with the jumpshot</p>
We could lock it down, never unlock</p>
I said, back at it again with the jumpshot</p>
I'm aiming for you and I won't stop</p>
Back at it again with the jumpshot</p>
We could lock it down only if</p>

We give it a shot</p>
You and I on the court</p>
Time ticking on the clock, baby, I'm a try to score</p>
Cause you the hottest on the block</p>
Ain't nothin' dimmin' your light</p>
But all the options that you got wouldn't ever treat you right, no</p>
I don't need a telescope to see the you're the one </p>
But I do need your time and if it ain't yours, I'd rather have none</p>
I don't need a fortune teller to tell me my fortune</p>
I have a million signs that my fortune just begun</p>
<br>
You got me jumping like</p>
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom</p>
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom</p>
Boom shakalak, boom shakalak, ooh</p>
Wanna hold you down (oh no)</p>
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom</p>
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom</p>
Boom shakalak, boom shakalak, ooh</p>
Wanna hold you down </p>

I said, back at it again with the jumpshot</p>
I'm aiming for you and I won't stop</p>
Back at it again with the jumpshot </p>
We could lock it down, never unlock </p>
I said, back at it again with the jumpshot</p>
I'm aiming for you and I won't stop</p>
Back at it again with the jumpshot</p>
We could lock it down, never unclock</p>
<br>
Jumping into something, I don't really know what to expect </p>
But outta your team, you're the MVP and you'll never be less</p>
And baby, the past was nothing but practice, now I'm set</p>
When you give me access, I'll just sew my heart into your chest</p>

You got me jumping like  </p>
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom </p>
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom</p>
Boom shaka, boom shake, ooh </p>
Wanna hold you down  </p>
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom </p>
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom</p>
Boom shakala, boom shakala, ooh</p>
Wanna hold you down</p>
